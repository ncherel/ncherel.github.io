* Should you compress your image dataset? No.

With new image formats such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF][AVIF]] (based on AV1), is it worth compressing
your images for neural network training to save on disk space? Short answer is no.

AVIF is gaining support across many different softwares and libraries, offering significant disk space savings
compared to JPEG (see below).
At the same time, image datasets are getting larger and larger, and it could be useful
to compress them with smarter algorithms to reduce their size. However, complex compression
requires more operations for decoding and may slow down the training loop.

**What's the trade-off between image size and decoding time?**

To answer this question, I compared the decoding times from disk to tensor of different algorithms.
In addition to different PNG settings, I also tested AVIF available to PyTorch through the [[https://github.com/pytorch-labs/torchvision-extra-decoders][torchvision-extra-decoders]] package.

Using the [[https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/][DIV2K]] validation set, which is composed of 100 high-resolution images (~2000x1000),
I measured the average decoding time and file size of several lossless compression algorithms.

The compression algorithms compared are:
- PNG with compression level 9 (maximum compression)
- PNG with compression level 6 (default compression)
- PNG with compression level 0 (no compression)
- AVIF lossless (libaom-av1)
- [[https://zarr.dev/][ZARR]], a library for tensor storage (some compression, default parameters)

Experiments are run on my laptop (4 CPU cores, NVMe M.2) and may not represent performance
in a cluster environment with more CPUs and shared storage.

| Compression | decoding time (s) | file size (MB) |
|-------------+-------------------+----------------|
| PNG-9       |              3.91 |           4.24 |
| PNG-6       |              3.67 |           4.29 |
| PNG-0       |              2.11 |           8.12 |
| AVIF        |             17.40 |           3.71 |
| ZARR        |              1.03 |           7.51 |

While AVIF offers better compression than PNG, its decoding process is much slower.
**AVIF is too slow for use in a training loop** but may be useful for long-term storage or distributing datasets.
Uncompressed images (PNG-0) or direct tensor storage (ZARR) produce larger files but are quicker to load into memory.
