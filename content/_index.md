## About Me

I am a 1st year PhD student at Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) under the supervision of Alasdair Newson, Yann Gousseau, and Andrés Almansa. My research interests are video / image editing, data generation, deep learning, and computer vision.
Before that, I worked at [Gleamer](http://www.gleamer.ai) on bone fracture detection in x-ray images.
I graduated from Télécom Paris, and obtained the "Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage" (MVA) Master's degree from ENS Paris-Saclay.
